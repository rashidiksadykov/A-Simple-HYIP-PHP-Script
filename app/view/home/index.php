                                                      After you register/login, to access your account.
From your dashboard page you click on the 'make donation' button.
Simply pick someone who is to receive money from the list, input amount in dollars not less than $40 (&#8358;20000) or more than $500 (&#8358;25000) and click on 'reserve'.
You choose to pay either part or the entire money the person is to receive as splitting within minimum and maximum amount ranges is allowed.
Once your payment has been confirmed you would be queued on the list to be paid 130% of the money you donated i.e you get 130% interest. 
Get paid too and don't be greedy, redonate to other users too and earn more.
However we give no guarantees and promises! Neither explicit nor implicit .
